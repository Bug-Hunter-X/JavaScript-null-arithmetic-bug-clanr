This repository contains a simple JavaScript function that demonstrates a subtle bug involving null values in arithmetic operations. The bug arises from the implicit type coercion in JavaScript when comparing null with numbers. The solution provides a more robust way to handle null values to prevent unexpected behavior.  The original code incorrectly returns null even if only one of the inputs is null and there should be a reasonable default.
